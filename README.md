## About

This project was built by Youssef as a learning exercise in C programming.  

The goal was to practice:
- Writing modular code using multiple `.c` and `.h` files
- Building a simple user interface in the terminal
- Using file input/output (I/O) to store and load data
- Organizing a C project with a clean folder structure

This is one of the first full projects Iâ€™ve built in C.  
It helped understanding how real C programs are structured beyond small code snippets.
